The next day, Secretary McDonald's Chief Innovations Officer received a domonstration of the Scheduling Calendar View/Veteran Appointment Request application, as well as a number of others developed with the help of the LongView Mobile Team. The Innovations Officer, in turn, demonstrated the Scheduling application for both Secretary McDonald and Newt Gingrich, both of whom said the application was perfect, and exactly what the Veterans need. They congratulated the project team and the LongView Consultants on their forward thinking and creative work. I received special thanks and recognition for my efforts.</p>",
