			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			    While I have a wide variety of skills in the IT arena, my main focus is in Front-End Web Development. Working with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and MV*s such as Angular and Backbone, I am able to create responsive web applications for your company. Currently I am working with the Department of Veterans Affairs creating backbone applications using tools such as, jQuery Mobile, Grunt, Require.js, Qunit, and Twitter Bootstrap. In the past I worked on the HTML5 and CSS3 of the Affordable Health Care Act for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which was passed under President Barack Hussein Obama. I am the only Front-End Developer that spanned across all three entities of this project which includes Plan Management, Financial Management, and Eligibility & Enrollment.
