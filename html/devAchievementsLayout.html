<p>
	I am very active in learning the latest and greatest technologies.
	Teamtreehouse is one of the sites that I use to learn best practices, 
	diving into javascript primarily, but I plan to expand my knowledge into other areas to give myself better perspective.
	Teamtreehouse was kind enough to provide data that I can pull and show here of the learning modules that I have completed.
