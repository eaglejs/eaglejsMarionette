	I am very active in learning the latest and greatest technologies.
	Teamtreehouse is one of the sites that I use to learn the best practices for professional web applications.
	I dive into javascript primarily, but I plan to expand my knowledge so that I can be a full-stack developer. 
	(This is one of many goals.) <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Teamtreehouse.com</a> was 
	kind enough to provide data of the learning modules I have completed that I can pull from their site and display it here.
